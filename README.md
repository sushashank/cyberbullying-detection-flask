# 🚨 Cyberbullying Detection Web App (Flask + Machine Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that detects cyberbullying in user-provided text using machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system loads a trained machine learning model and vectorizer to classify whether the given text contains cyberbullying content and displays the result in real time through a web interface.
